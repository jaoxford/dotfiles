# My dotfiles

A sensible place for different things related to my setup

## Installing aliases

Firstly you'll need to copy the `.aliases` file to the root directory

```shell
cp ~/Projects/dotfiles/.aliases ~/.aliases
```

Then copy the contents of the `.zshrc` file from this directory to the home directory's `.zshrc` file

```shell
cp ~/Projects/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

## Installing homebrew packages

You'll need to run the `./macos/brew.sh` file to install the homebrew packages.
